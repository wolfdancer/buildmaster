h1. Push-Button Release

BuildMaster provides an easy way for the
user to invoke the programs needed for releasing a project. It also checks the return
value of the program executation and raise the error if it is not zero.
Since you are writing your scripts in Ruby, you will be able to run them in all the
platforms that Ruby can.

A push button release requires the interaction among the following three components:

|_.Component|_.Description|_.Examples|
|"Version Control System":version-control.html|aka VCS for checking-in, checking-out, tagging, etc.|"CVS":http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/, "Subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/|
