h1. Create Site Specification

Create a site specifcation file @sitespec.rb@:

<template:code source="site_spec_yaml_sample.rb" tag="site spec sample" syntax="ruby"/>

h1. Create Content

Let's start by creating @index.textile@ as the first content.  The @textile@ extention tells
@BuildMaster@ the format of the content.  You can also create an @index.html@ if you
prefer writing the content in HTML, or @index.markdown@ for MarkDown.

Optionally you can specify the title of the page with the header.  This is a BuildMaster specific syntax but it has
turned out to be very useful.

<pre class="code">-------------------------------------
Home Page Title
-------------------------------------
h1. Header

Hello @BuildMaster@ World!
</pre>

For full reference on textile notation, see "Textile Reference":http://hobix.com/textile/

h1. Build the Site

Build the site by typing the following command and the HTML files will be generated in the @output_dir@ that you
have specified in the site specification.

<pre class="code">ruby sitespec.rb server</pre>

This will start an HTTP server that serves files based on @content@ directory.  Just point your browser to
""http://localhost:2000":http://localhost:2000".

For more information, including running the server and testing the website, see "Build Site References":reference.html
