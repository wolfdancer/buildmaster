Cotta
-------------------
h1. Concept

Cotta is a set of classes that was ported from the 
"Java implementation":http://cotta.sourceforge.net, and is currently part of BuildMaster, before its style
becomes mainstream.

For idea of Cotta, see "Cotta Power":http://cotta.sourceforge.net/power.html

The following items are the main differences for Cotta:

* File and directories are presented as CottaFile and CottaDirectory
* Parent directories are created automatically when creating a file or directory
* Children are deleted automatically when deleting a directory
* More specific file operation names like load/save, read/write.

h1. Code

For those we just want to read one webpage to know the basics instead of read the "rDoc":../rdoc/index.html.

h2. Instantiation

You can instantiate a @CottaFile@ and @CottaDirectory@ by injecting different file system into @Cotta@.

<template:code source="cotta-samples.rb" tag="create" syntax="ruby"/>

h2. Simple Operations

Basic file/directory supports are available.

<template:code source="cotta-samples.rb" tag="ops" syntax="ruby" />

h2. File Operations

File operations follow the same behaviors of @File@ in ruby, except they are not static.

<template:code source="cotta-samples.rb" tag="io" syntax="ruby" />
